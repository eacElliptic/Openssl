This file contains some results of tests.

The computer used has these features: 
	- Model		: Dell Precision Tower 3620
	- OS		: Ubuntu gnome 16.04 (64 bits)
	- Processor	: Intel Core i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz Ã— 8 
	- Memory 	: 32GB
	- gcc		: version 5.4.0 20160609

Note : We have deactivated Intel-turbo boost technology and choosed stable frequency for CPU in the Bios before doing our tests.

For glv, we used SECG curve secp256k1, command : ./apps/openssl speed ecdhk256

For EAC-mult, we used a curve on a field of size 358 bits, command : ./apps/openssl speed ecdheac256

These curves are supposed to provide security of 128 bits.

Results below correspond to numbers of operations per second.
An operation is the computation of 'kP' on the corresponding curve.
